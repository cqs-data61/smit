# This section configures information for paths to certificate related files.

# IMPORTANT: CERT and CSR of this section indicates for path to TEMPORARY files generated during the certificate generation.
# DO NOT set these values to CA's certificate or CSR file.

# Set path to temporary certificate
CERT = "tmpcert.pem"
# Set path to temporary CSR
CSR = "tmpcsr.csr"
# Set path to message signer (manufacturer) certificate.
# This setting will be used to verify if a signature of a message is valid.
# This path should be an ABSOLUTE path.
SIGCERT = "/home/nanl/testdir/Manufac/manu.sg.com.cert.pem"
# Set path to CA chain for message signer (manufacturer) certificate.
# This setting will be used to verify if a signature of a message is valid.
# This path should be an ABSOLUTE path.
SIGCHAIN = "/home/nanl/SG-CA/cacert.pem"

# Set URL to OCSP server
# Note that this setting should usually be consistant with the setting in "ocspcnf"
# That is the port number set here should be identical to "OCSPPORT" in ocspcnf.
# The demo uses the localhost for OCSP server.

# In out case, this should be the one used to private root CA rather than simulated global CA.

############
#
# Set if the certificate is self-signed or CA-signed.
# If it is a self-signed certificate type, set it to 'y', so that the certificate is signed by user it self.
# If it is a CA-signed certificate type, set it to 'n', so that the certificate should be signed by CA.

# Set path to certificate database on CA. This path MUST be consistant with the path set in openssl
# configuration file /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf. For example, the path could be "$dir/index.txt", where $dir is a variable defined in openssl configuration file.
# In this example, let $dir="~/SMIT-CA", the path to database is "~/SMIT-CA/index.txt".
# If it is not CA, leave it blank or omit it.
CERTDB = "/home/nanl/SMIT-CA/index.txt"
# Set path to certificate storage directory on CA. This path MUST be consistant with the path set in openssl
# configuration file /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf. For example, the path could be "\$dir/newcerts", where $dir is a variable defined in openssl configuration file.
# In this example, let $dir="~/SMIT-CA", the path to database is "~/SMIT-CA/newcerts".
